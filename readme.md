# LibreForge Framework

## LibreForge Platform
LibreForge platform is WIX for enterprise - no code integrated development environment to let enterprises and agencies build user facing portals.

![Overall Design](docs/diagrams/context.png "Overall Design")

One of the main pillar of platform is open source LibreForge Framework.  
The open source nature of framework empowers organizations to avoid vendor lock by providing freedom of choice, 
enabling customization and control over the source code, ensuring long-term viability independent of vendor roadmaps,
promoting interoperability, and enhancing security through community-driven transparency and vigilance.

## Framework Abstractions

This section delineates the framework's provided abstractions, essential for implementing a standardized collection of components, actions, etc. 
Furthermore, it defines the guiding principles of design that developers are expected to adhere to when crafting custom implementations.
